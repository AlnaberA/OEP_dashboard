Sid,4/15/2016,4/29/2016,10,Clarify fuse tables between  1-10-5 and 12-4-2 Cliff we just had the discussion about what is the proper fuse size to use for the 50kVA isolation transformer without secondary tied to it. The fuse size should be a 25k and this is referred to on OH Spec. page 1-10-5. I have been trained and have been utilizing Table 1 for fusing of all OH transformers 4.8 & 13.2. I have also checked the sectionalizing fuses on the circuit to be sure the transformer fuse isn't larger than the sectionalizing fuse. Normally the 100KVA transformer can cause an issue with the 65K fuse application. I have had a couple of issues with this and involved Engineering and Relay. The second issue is the page identification (Title block). 1-10-4 list it as 4.8KV & 8.32KV (Parts of Pontiac) and page 1-10-5 as 13.2KV. The only time I utilized page 1-10-5 is for the capacitor fuse size. If my prior training and application of utilizing Table 1 for all OH transformers is the correct method then maybe the title blockshould be changed to reflect this. Others please feel free to add input as I may have been doing this wrong for the last 24 years. Just an FYI - I looked into my old orange-covered spec book from 1984.  These tables have not been changed much over the years.  Very much the same as current book.  The only difference being the addition of the 8.32kV heading - that happened sometime in the late 80's that DECo bought the Pontiac area from Consumer's Power.  And the addition of a bolt-on limiter column in both tables. In the orange book: 1-10-6 has the 13kV fuse table 7 (now on 1-10-5) and the capacitor fuse sizes for that voltage. This orange one is the book that was in place when I was trained and these are the 2 pages (in the current iteration) that I still use to determine the fuses for these 2 voltages.  I have always followed the main heading on the table and used the 4.8 kV table for all xfmrs at that voltage and the 13 kv table for all at that voltage.,1,,,,,,Yes,ON HOLD,

Spec 16-52 16-53 doesn't shows the regulator having a bypass switch and doesn't have a note about having a sectionalizing switch on the source side on a separate pole. This was brought up because of a 1ph 4.8kV reg that I'm having installed on a circuit where we wanted the bypass and source switch.,,Justin Gillon,,,,,,,

The first splicing crew on  the job made several valid points why we should use one three phase transformer instead of the A-B transformer detail.
